# ipwatch

This program gets for your external IP address, checks it against your "saved" IP address and, if a difference is found, emails you the new IP. This is useful for servers at residential locations whose IP address may change periodically due to actions #by the ISP.

USAGE: python3 ipwatch.py [config]
USAGE: ./ipwatch.py [config]

[config] = path to an IPWatch configuration file
